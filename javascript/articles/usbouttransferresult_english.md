# USBOutTransferResult in JavaScript: Understanding USB Data Transfer Results

## Synopsis
The `USBOutTransferResult` is a JavaScript interface that encapsulates the result of a USB data transfer operation, specifically when data is sent to a USB device. It provides essential information about the status of the transfer, including whether it succeeded and how much data was sent.

## Documentation
The `USBOutTransferResult` object is part of the Web USB API, which allows web applications to interact with USB devices directly from the browser. This interface provides a structured way to handle the outcome of an `outTransfer` operation, which is crucial for developers working with hardware communication.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `USBOutTransferResult` is to deliver feedback on the success or failure of a data transfer operation to a USB device. This feedback is vital for ensuring reliable communication and handling errors effectively.

### Properties
- **status**: A string indicating the status of the transfer. It can be "ok" if the transfer was successful or an error message if it failed.
- **bytesWritten**: An integer representing the number of bytes successfully written to the USB device during the transfer.

### Usage
To utilize the `USBOutTransferResult`, developers typically handle the result of a USB transfer operation by using the `transferOut()` method of a USB device's interface. The result of this operation is then processed as an instance of `USBOutTransferResult`.

### Example Code
Hereâ€™s a simple example illustrating how to handle a USB out transfer and interpret the result:

```javascript
async function sendDataToUSBDevice(device, data) {
    try {
        const result = await device.transferOut(1, data);
        
        if (result.status === 'ok') {
            console.log(`Successfully sent ${result.bytesWritten} bytes to the device.`);
        } else {
            console.error(`Transfer failed: ${result.status}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('An error occurred during the transfer:', error);
    }
}
```

In this example, data is sent to a USB device, and the result is checked to inform the user of the transfer's success or failure.

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Device Not Found**: Ensure that the USB device is properly connected and accessible. If the device is not found, the `transferOut` method may throw an error.
- **Incorrect Endpoint**: Make sure that the endpoint used in `transferOut()` matches the configuration of the USB device. Using an incorrect endpoint can lead to transfer failures.

### Additional Notes
- Always handle exceptions when working with USB transfers, as various issues can arise, such as device disconnection or permission errors.
- The Web USB API is supported in modern browsers, but it is essential to check for compatibility before using it in production environments.

## One Line Summary
`USBOutTransferResult` is a JavaScript interface that provides the outcome of data transfers to USB devices, including success status and bytes written.
