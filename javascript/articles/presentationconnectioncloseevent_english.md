# Understanding the PresentationConnectionCloseEvent in JavaScript

## Synopsis
The `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent` in JavaScript is an event triggered when a presentation connection is terminated. This event is part of the Presentation API, which enables web applications to control and interact with presentation displays.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent` is specifically used in the context of the Presentation API. It provides developers with a way to respond to the closing of a connection between a presenting device (like a smartphone or laptop) and a receiving device (like a smart TV or projector). This event is crucial for managing the state and ensuring a seamless user experience during presentations.

### Usage
The `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent` can be listened for on a `PresentationConnection` object. Developers can use this event to execute specific actions when a presentation connection is closed, such as cleaning up resources, updating the UI, or notifying users.

### Properties
- **type**: The type of the event, which will be a string value of "close".
- **connection**: A reference to the `PresentationConnection` object that was closed.

### Event Handling
To handle the `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent`, you would typically set up an event listener on the `PresentationConnection` instance as follows:

```javascript
const connection = new PresentationConnection();

connection.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('Presentation connection closed:', event);
});
```

## Examples
Here are some basic usage examples:

### Example 1: Handling Connection Close Event

```javascript
const presentation = new Presentation();
const connection = presentation.start();

connection.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('The presentation connection has been closed.');
    // Perform additional cleanup or state updates here
});
```

### Example 2: Notifying the User

```javascript
connection.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    alert('The presentation connection has been terminated. Please check your devices.');
});
```

## Explanation
While using the `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent`, developers should be aware of the following:

- **Event Timing**: The event is fired after the connection has been successfully closed, which means any attempts to interact with the connection afterward will be ineffective.
- **Multiple Listeners**: If multiple listeners are added for the `close` event, all of them will be executed in the order they were added.
- **Connection States**: Keep in mind that the connection may enter different states (e.g., connecting, connected, closed). Always check the connection state before performing operations.

## One Line Summary
The `PresentationConnectionCloseEvent` is an event that notifies developers when a presentation connection is terminated in JavaScript applications.
