# Understanding CloseEvent in JavaScript: Handling WebSocket and EventSource Connections

## Synopsis
The `CloseEvent` interface in JavaScript provides a way to handle events related to the closure of WebSocket and EventSource connections, allowing developers to manage connection states effectively.

## Documentation
The `CloseEvent` interface represents an event that is dispatched when a connection, such as a WebSocket or an EventSource, is closed. It provides information about the closure, including a code, reason, and whether the closure was clean.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `CloseEvent` is to inform developers when a connection has been terminated either intentionally or due to an error. This is essential for managing the lifecycle of connections in real-time web applications.

### Usage
`CloseEvent` is typically used in the context of the `WebSocket` and `EventSource` APIs. When a connection is closed, the `onclose` event handler is triggered, passing a `CloseEvent` object as an argument.

### Properties
- **code**: A numeric value representing the status code indicating the reason for the closure of the connection.
- **reason**: A human-readable string providing more details about the closure.
- **wasClean**: A boolean value indicating whether the connection was closed cleanly (i.e., without any errors).

### Example
```javascript
// Example using WebSocket
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');

socket.onopen = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket is open now.');
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket is closed now.');
    console.log('Code:', event.code);
    console.log('Reason:', event.reason);
    console.log('Was clean:', event.wasClean);
};

// Close the socket after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    socket.close(1000, 'Done');
}, 5000);
```

## Explanation
Common pitfalls when working with `CloseEvent` include:
- **Not checking the `wasClean` property**: Failing to verify whether the connection was closed cleanly can lead to misunderstandings about the state of the application.
- **Ignoring the `code` and `reason` properties**: These provide critical information about the closure, which can be useful for debugging or informing users about connection issues.
- **Assuming immediate reconnections**: After a closure event, automatically trying to reconnect without considering the reason for closure may lead to inefficient resource usage or further errors.

Other considerations include being aware of the different status codes defined in the WebSocket protocol, as they can vary in meaning and impact how you handle reconnections or other application logic.

## One Line Summary
The `CloseEvent` interface in JavaScript is used to handle events related to the closure of WebSocket and EventSource connections, providing essential details for connection management.
