# DecompressionStream in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `DecompressionStream` is a built-in JavaScript API that allows developers to decompress data streams in a web environment, facilitating the handling of compressed data formats like Gzip and Brotli.

## Documentation 

### Purpose
The `DecompressionStream` interface is primarily used to decompress data that has been compressed using various algorithms. This is particularly useful for web applications that need to handle large datasets efficiently and for services that communicate over the network with compressed payloads.

### Usage
To use `DecompressionStream`, you need to create an instance of the stream and then pipe the compressed data into it. The decompressed output can then be read from the resulting stream.

### Constructor
```javascript
new DecompressionStream(format);
```
#### Parameters
- `format` (optional): A string indicating the compression format. Supported formats include `'gzip'` and `'brotli'`. If not specified, it defaults to `'gzip'`.

### Methods
- **ReadableStream**: The `DecompressionStream` returns a `ReadableStream` that contains the decompressed data.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use `DecompressionStream` to decompress Gzip data:

```javascript
// Assume compressedData is a Uint8Array containing Gzip compressed data
async function decompressData(compressedData) {
    const decompressionStream = new DecompressionStream('gzip');
    const readableStream = decompressionStream.readable;

    // Create a writable stream to consume the decompressed data
    const writer = readableStream.getWriter();

    // Create a new ReadableStream from the compressed data
    const compressedStream = new ReadableStream({
        start(controller) {
            controller.enqueue(compressedData);
            controller.close();
        }
    });

    // Pipe the compressed stream to the decompression stream
    compressedStream.pipeTo(decompressionStream.writable);

    // Read the decompressed data
    const reader = readableStream.getReader();
    let result = '';
    let done, value;

    while ({ done, value } = await reader.read(), !done) {
        result += new TextDecoder().decode(value);
    }

    return result; // Returns the decompressed string
}
```

## Explanation
When using `DecompressionStream`, there are a few common pitfalls and considerations:

- **Browser Support**: Ensure that the environment where you plan to use `DecompressionStream` supports it. As of October 2023, it is supported in most modern browsers, but check compatibility if targeting older versions.
  
- **Compressed Data Format**: Make sure that the format specified in the constructor matches the actual format of the compressed data. Using an incorrect format may lead to decompression errors.
  
- **Stream Handling**: Be cautious about how you handle streams. Properly manage the state of both readable and writable streams to avoid memory leaks or unhandled exceptions.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for the streams, as decompression may fail due to corrupted data or unsupported formats.

## One Line Summary
`DecompressionStream` is a JavaScript API for efficiently decompressing data streams in web applications.
