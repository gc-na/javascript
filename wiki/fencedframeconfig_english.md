# FencedFrameConfig: A Comprehensive Guide for JavaScript Developers

## Synopsis
FencedFrameConfig is a configuration object used in JavaScript to define the properties and behaviors of a fenced frame, which is a type of user interface component that provides an isolated environment for rendering content securely.

## Documentation

### Purpose
FencedFrameConfig serves to enhance the security and functionality of web applications by allowing developers to create fenced frames. These frames can prevent potentially harmful content from affecting the parent document while still enabling the display of dynamic content.

### Usage
FencedFrameConfig is typically used in conjunction with Web APIs that support fenced frames, such as the `FencedFrame` API. Developers can customize the behavior of the fenced frame by setting various properties within the configuration object.

### Properties
- **src** (String): The URL of the content to be loaded within the fenced frame.
- **sandbox** (Array): An array of sandboxing options that restrict the capabilities of the fenced frame. Common options include 'allow-scripts', 'allow-same-origin', and 'allow-forms'.
- **name** (String): A unique name for the fenced frame, which can be used for identification purposes.
- **title** (String): A user-friendly title for the fenced frame, improving accessibility and SEO.

### Example Configuration
```javascript
const fencedFrameConfig = {
    src: 'https://example.com/content',
    sandbox: ['allow-scripts', 'allow-same-origin'],
    name: 'myFencedFrame',
    title: 'Example Fenced Frame'
};
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
To create a fenced frame using the FencedFrameConfig:

```javascript
const fencedFrame = new FencedFrame(fencedFrameConfig);
document.body.appendChild(fencedFrame);
```

### Advanced Configuration
You can customize the fenced frame further by adding event listeners or modifying properties after creation:

```javascript
fencedFrame.addEventListener('load', () => {
    console.log('Fenced frame has loaded content.');
});
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
- **Incorrect URL**: Ensure that the `src` property points to a valid and accessible URL; otherwise, the frame will fail to load.
- **Sandbox Restrictions**: Be cautious when using the `sandbox` property. Overly restrictive settings may prevent necessary functionality, such as JavaScript execution or form submissions.
- **Cross-Origin Issues**: Loading content from domains that do not permit cross-origin access can lead to errors, so be mindful of CORS policies.

### Additional Notes
- Fenced frames are designed to improve security by isolating potentially harmful content. Use them in applications that require strict content security.
- Always test the fenced frame behavior across different browsers to ensure compatibility, as support may vary.

## One Line Summary
FencedFrameConfig is a JavaScript configuration object that defines the properties and security settings for creating secure fenced frames in web applications.
