# EncodedAudioChunk in JavaScript: Understanding the Audio Encoding API

## Synopsis
`EncodedAudioChunk` is a JavaScript interface that represents a chunk of audio data that has been encoded for efficient processing and playback. This feature is part of the Encoding API, aimed at providing developers with a way to manipulate audio streams in modern web applications.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `EncodedAudioChunk` interface is designed for use with the `AudioEncoder` API, which facilitates the encoding of raw audio data into compressed formats. This is particularly useful for developers working with audio streaming, recording, or any application that requires the efficient handling of audio data.

### Usage
To utilize `EncodedAudioChunk`, developers typically instantiate it as a part of the audio encoding process. The chunk contains encoded audio data along with metadata, such as the timestamp and the duration of the audio chunk.

### Properties
- **data**: The encoded audio data as a `TypedArray`. This property contains binary data that represents the audio chunk.
- **timestamp**: A double value representing the time at which the audio chunk is captured. This is usually in milliseconds and helps in synchronizing audio playback.
- **duration**: A double value that specifies the duration of the audio chunk, typically measured in milliseconds.

### Constructor
While `EncodedAudioChunk` itself is an interface and cannot be instantiated directly, it is generated by the `AudioEncoder` when audio data is processed.

## Examples
### Basic Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use `EncodedAudioChunk` within an audio encoding context:

```javascript
// Create an instance of AudioEncoder
const audioEncoder = new AudioEncoder({
    output: (chunk) => {
        // Process the encoded audio chunk
        console.log('Encoded chunk:', chunk);
        console.log('Chunk data:', chunk.data);
        console.log('Timestamp:', chunk.timestamp);
        console.log('Duration:', chunk.duration);
    },
    error: (err) => {
        console.error('Encoding error:', err);
    }
});

// Configure the encoder
audioEncoder.configure({
    codec: 'opus',
    sampleRate: 48000,
    numberOfChannels: 2,
});

// Feed raw audio data into the encoder
audioEncoder.encode(rawAudioData); // rawAudioData should be a TypedArray of PCM audio data
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Incorrect Data Format**: Ensure that the raw audio data passed to the encoder is in the correct format (e.g., PCM) to avoid encoding errors.
2. **Timing Issues**: The `timestamp` and `duration` properties must be managed properly to synchronize audio playback. Incorrect values can lead to audio playback issues.
3. **Browser Support**: As with many web APIs, ensure that the target browsers support the Encoding API and `EncodedAudioChunk`. Always check for compatibility.

### Additional Notes
- The `EncodedAudioChunk` is typically used in conjunction with the `AudioEncoder` and `AudioDecoder` APIs, making it crucial for developers focusing on real-time audio processing and playback.
- Ensure that you handle asynchronous operations properly, as encoding can take time depending on the data size and encoding settings.

## One Line Summary
`EncodedAudioChunk` is a JavaScript interface that encapsulates encoded audio data for efficient processing and playback in web applications.
