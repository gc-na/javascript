# TrustedHTML in JavaScript: Ensuring Secure HTML Content

## Synopsis
TrustedHTML is a security feature in JavaScript that allows developers to safely handle and manipulate HTML content without exposing applications to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Documentation
### Purpose
TrustedHTML is designed to create a secure representation of HTML content. It helps developers prevent potential XSS attacks by ensuring that only trusted HTML is processed and rendered. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic content generated from user inputs or external sources.

### Usage
To use TrustedHTML, developers can generate a TrustedHTML object through the use of a secure API provided by the browser. The process usually involves the following steps:

1. **Create a TrustedHTML object**: Use the appropriate API to create a TrustedHTML object.
2. **Use TrustedHTML for rendering**: Pass the TrustedHTML object to functions or elements that require HTML content.

### Details
- TrustedHTML objects are immutable, meaning that once created, their content cannot be altered.
- They help in differentiating between trusted and untrusted HTML, thus enhancing security measures in web applications.
- The API for TrustedHTML is part of the broader set of web security features aimed at maintaining a secure web environment.

## Examples
### Example 1: Creating a TrustedHTML Object
```javascript
// Create a TrustedHTML object
const trustedHtml = TrustedHTML.create('<div>Hello, World!</div>');

// Use the TrustedHTML object in a secure context
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = trustedHtml;
```

### Example 2: Rendering TrustedHTML
```javascript
// Assuming a TrustedHTML object named 'trustedHtml' was created
function renderContent() {
    const outputElement = document.getElementById('content');
    outputElement.innerHTML = trustedHtml; // securely render the HTML
}
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Directly Inserting Untrusted Content**: One of the most common mistakes is inserting untrusted HTML directly into the DOM, which can lead to XSS attacks.
- **Not Using TrustedHTML**: Failing to utilize TrustedHTML for dynamic content can expose applications to vulnerabilities. Always ensure that dynamic HTML is wrapped in a TrustedHTML object.
  
### Gotchas
- **Browser Support**: Ensure that the browser you are targeting supports TrustedHTML, as it may not be available in all environments.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Even with TrustedHTML, ensure that your applicationâ€™s CSP is appropriately configured to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

## One Line Summary
TrustedHTML is a security feature in JavaScript that allows safe handling of HTML content to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
