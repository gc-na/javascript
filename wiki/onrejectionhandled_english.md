# Understanding the `onrejectionhandled` Event in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `onrejectionhandled` event in JavaScript is an event that is triggered when a Promise rejection has been handled. This event provides a way to catch and respond to unhandled promise rejections, ensuring better error management in asynchronous code.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `onrejectionhandled` event is part of the Promise API in JavaScript. It allows developers to define a custom handler for when a previously rejected Promise is later handled. This is particularly useful for tracking and debugging promise rejections in complex asynchronous workflows.

### Usage
The `onrejectionhandled` event can be used to attach a handler function that executes whenever a rejection is handled. This is done by assigning a function to the `window.onrejectionhandled` property. The handler receives an event object that contains information about the rejected promise.

### Syntax
```javascript
window.onrejectionhandled = function(event) {
    // Your handling code here
};
```

### Event Object
The event object passed to the handler contains the following properties:
- `reason`: The reason for the rejection (the value passed to `Promise.reject()`).
- `promise`: The Promise object that was rejected.

## Examples

### Basic Example
Here is a simple example of how to use `onrejectionhandled`:

```javascript
// Define a rejected promise
const myPromise = Promise.reject("Something went wrong!");

// Attach the onrejectionhandled event
window.onrejectionhandled = function(event) {
    console.log("Promise was handled:", event.promise);
    console.log("Reason for rejection:", event.reason);
};

// Handling the rejection
myPromise.catch(error => console.log("Caught error:", error));
```

### Handling Multiple Rejections
You can set up the `onrejectionhandled` handler to manage multiple promises:

```javascript
// Multiple rejected promises
const promise1 = Promise.reject("Error in promise 1");
const promise2 = Promise.reject("Error in promise 2");

window.onrejectionhandled = function(event) {
    console.log("Handled:", event.promise, "Reason:", event.reason);
};

promise1.catch(err => console.log("Caught:", err));
promise2.catch(err => console.log("Caught:", err));
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
- **Not Assigning a Handler**: If you do not assign a handler to `onrejectionhandled`, you will not receive notifications when promises are handled.
- **Scope of `this`**: Inside the `onrejectionhandled` function, `this` may not refer to the expected context if you use arrow functions. Use regular functions to ensure the correct context.
- **Global Scope**: The `onrejectionhandled` property is a global event, which means it applies to the entire window. Ensure this does not conflict with other global event handlers.

### Debugging Promise Rejections
The `onrejectionhandled` event is particularly useful for debugging because it allows developers to log or respond to promise rejections that were caught after they were initially rejected.

### Additional Notes
- The `onrejectionhandled` event is part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) specification and is supported in most modern browsers.
- Using this event effectively can lead to cleaner code and better error management in applications that rely heavily on asynchronous operations.

## One Line Summary
The `onrejectionhandled` event in JavaScript allows developers to respond to promise rejections once they have been handled, improving error management in asynchronous code.
