# Understanding USBIsochronousInTransferResult in JavaScript

## Synopsis
USBIsochronousInTransferResult is a JavaScript object that represents the result of an isochronous data transfer from a USB device to the host system. It is part of the WebUSB API, enabling developers to interact with USB devices in a standardized way.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The USBIsochronousInTransferResult object is designed to handle the results of isochronous transfers, which are essential for streaming data, such as audio or video, where timely delivery is critical. This object provides information about the data received and any associated status.

### Usage
To use USBIsochronousInTransferResult, developers typically engage it as part of the WebUSB API when performing isochronous transfers. This is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time data processing, such as media streaming or interactive devices.

### Properties
- **data**: A `BufferSource` containing the bytes received from the USB device.
- **status**: A string indicating the status of the transfer, which can be 'ok', 'stall', or 'error'. This helps in diagnosing issues with the transfer.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use USBIsochronousInTransferResult in a JavaScript application:

```javascript
// Example of using USBIsochronousInTransferResult
async function transferData(device) {
    try {
        const transferResult = await device.transferIn(1, 64); // Transfer 64 bytes
        if (transferResult.status === 'ok') {
            const data = new Uint8Array(transferResult.data.buffer);
            console.log('Received Data:', data);
        } else {
            console.error('Transfer Error:', transferResult.status);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Transfer failed:', error);
    }
}

// Assuming `device` is a connected USB device
transferData(device);
```

## Explanation
When using USBIsochronousInTransferResult, developers should be aware of a few common pitfalls:

1. **Transfer Size**: Ensure that the requested transfer size does not exceed the capabilities of the USB device. This can lead to 'error' status in the transfer result.
  
2. **Timing**: Isochronous transfers are time-sensitive. If the host cannot keep up with the data flow, it may result in lost data or errors.

3. **Device Compatibility**: Not all USB devices support isochronous transfers. Make sure the device in use is compatible with this type of transfer.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where the transfer results in 'stall' or 'error' statuses.

## One Line Summary
USBIsochronousInTransferResult is a JavaScript object used to manage and interpret the results of isochronous data transfers from USB devices.
