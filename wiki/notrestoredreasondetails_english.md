# NotRestoredReasonDetails in JavaScript: Understanding State Restoration Failure

## Synopsis
NotRestoredReasonDetails is a JavaScript feature that provides insights into the reasons why a web application's state could not be restored during page navigation. This is particularly relevant for developers utilizing the History API and session management in single-page applications (SPAs).

## Documentation
### Purpose
The NotRestoredReasonDetails feature is designed to help developers diagnose issues related to state restoration in web applications. It offers detailed information on why certain states cannot be reloaded, enabling more robust error handling and user experience improvements.

### Usage
In JavaScript, NotRestoredReasonDetails is typically encountered when interfacing with the History API or when managing application states via session storage. It provides a structured way to access and understand restoration failures.

### Details
- **Interface**: NotRestoredReasonDetails is not a standalone function but part of the broader web API that handles state management.
- **Properties**: The object typically includes properties such as `reason`, which indicates the type of failure (e.g., `sessionExpired`, `dataCorrupted`), and `timestamp`, which logs when the failure occurred.
- **Integration**: Developers can listen for state restoration events and handle the NotRestoredReasonDetails object to inform users or log issues for further investigation.

## Examples
### Basic Usage Example
```javascript
window.addEventListener('popstate', (event) => {
    if (event.state) {
        console.log("State restored:", event.state);
    } else {
        const reasonDetails = getNotRestoredReasonDetails(); // Hypothetical function
        console.error("State restoration failed:", reasonDetails);
    }
});

function getNotRestoredReasonDetails() {
    // This is a mock function for demonstration purposes.
    return {
        reason: 'sessionExpired',
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };
}
```

### Handling Restoration Failures
```javascript
function handleRestorationFailure(reasonDetails) {
    if (reasonDetails.reason === 'dataCorrupted') {
        alert("The data could not be restored due to corruption.");
    } else {
        console.warn("Unknown restoration issue:", reasonDetails);
    }
}

// Example call when restoration fails
const reasonDetails = getNotRestoredReasonDetails();
handleRestorationFailure(reasonDetails);
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring State Management**: Often, developers overlook the importance of properly managing application state, leading to frequent restoration failures.
2. **Session Expiry**: If the session storage expires and the application doesn't handle the scenario, users may face abrupt behavior, such as losing their progress.
3. **Error Logging**: Not logging the reasons for restoration failures can lead to difficulties in debugging and improving the application.

### Gotchas
- The NotRestoredReasonDetails may not always provide clear reasons, especially in complex applications where multiple factors could influence state restoration.
- Ensure that your application gracefully handles scenarios where state restoration fails, guiding users effectively rather than letting them experience abrupt interruptions.

## One Line Summary
NotRestoredReasonDetails is a JavaScript feature that aids developers in diagnosing state restoration failures during web application navigation.
