# WakeLockSentinel in JavaScript: Managing Device Wake States

## Synopsis
The `WakeLockSentinel` interface in JavaScript is part of the Wake Lock API, which enables web applications to request that the device remains awake and does not enter sleep mode. This is particularly useful for applications that require continuous interaction, such as video players or navigation applications.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `WakeLockSentinel` serves as a representation of a wake lock that has been obtained by a web application. It ensures that the device's screen stays on while the application is in use, thereby enhancing user experience by preventing interruptions from sleep mode.

### Usage
To use `WakeLockSentinel`, you first need to request a wake lock through the `navigator.wakeLock` API. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Request a Wake Lock**: Call the `navigator.wakeLock.request()` method, specifying the type of wake lock you want (e.g., "screen").
2. **Handle the Promise**: The method returns a Promise that resolves to a `WakeLockSentinel` object.
3. **Release the Wake Lock**: When the application no longer needs to keep the device awake, call the `release()` method on the `WakeLockSentinel` object.

### Syntax
```javascript
navigator.wakeLock.request('screen').then(function(wakeLock) {
    // Use the wakeLock object
}).catch(function(err) {
    console.error(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
});
```

### Parameters
- **type**: A string indicating the type of wake lock. Currently, the only supported type is `"screen"`.

### Properties
- **released**: A boolean value that indicates whether the wake lock has been released.

### Methods
- **release()**: Releases the wake lock, allowing the device to enter sleep mode.

## Examples
### Basic Wake Lock Usage
```javascript
async function requestWakeLock() {
    try {
        const wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
        console.log('Wake Lock is active');

        // Do something while the wake lock is active

        // When done
        await wakeLock.release();
        console.log('Wake Lock has been released');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
    }
}

requestWakeLock();
```

### Handling Wake Lock Release on Visibility Change
```javascript
let wakeLock = null;

async function requestWakeLock() {
    try {
        wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
        console.log('Wake Lock is active');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
    }
}

function releaseWakeLock() {
    if (wakeLock !== null) {
        wakeLock.release().then(() => {
            console.log('Wake Lock has been released');
            wakeLock = null;
        });
    }
}

document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
        requestWakeLock();
    } else {
        releaseWakeLock();
    }
});

requestWakeLock();
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Browser Support**: The Wake Lock API is not supported in all browsers. Always check for compatibility and feature support before implementation.
- **Permissions**: Depending on the implementation, some browsers may require user gestures (like a click) to grant a wake lock.
- **Memory Management**: Always ensure to release the wake lock when it is no longer necessary to avoid battery drain and unnecessary resource usage.

### Gotchas
- **Visibility Events**: If a wake lock is active and the user navigates away from the page (or the page becomes hidden), make sure to handle the release of the wake lock appropriately to prevent unwanted behavior.
- **Handling Errors**: Proper error handling is crucial, as wake locks can fail for various reasons, including system limitations or user interactions.

## One Line Summary
`WakeLockSentinel` is a JavaScript interface that allows web applications to prevent device sleep mode, enhancing user engagement for continuous interactions.
