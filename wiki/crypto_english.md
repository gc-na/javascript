# JavaScript Crypto API: Secure Cryptographic Operations in Web Development

## Synopsis
The JavaScript Crypto API provides a set of cryptographic functionalities that allow developers to implement secure operations such as hashing, encryption, and decryption in web applications, enhancing data integrity and security.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The JavaScript Crypto API is part of the Web Cryptography API, enabling secure cryptographic operations in web applications. It provides a standardized way to perform cryptographic functions, ensuring that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

### Usage
The Crypto API can be accessed through the `window.crypto` object in modern web browsers. It supports a range of cryptographic operations, including:

- **Hashing**: Creating a fixed-size hash value from input data.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Securing data using algorithms that require a key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Key Generation**: Creating cryptographic keys for various algorithms.

#### Key Methods
1. **SubtleCrypto**: The core interface that provides methods for cryptographic operations.
   - `encrypt(algorithm, key, data)`: Encrypts data using a specified algorithm and key.
   - `decrypt(algorithm, key, data)`: Decrypts data that was encrypted with a specified algorithm and key.
   - `digest(algorithm, data)`: Computes a hash of the input data.
   - `generateKey(algorithm, extractable, keyUsages)`: Generates a new cryptographic key.

### Details
The Crypto API operates asynchronously, returning promises for operations that may take time to complete. This design ensures that UI responsiveness is maintained during cryptographic operations. The API adheres to modern cryptographic standards, making it a reliable choice for developers concerned about security.

## Examples

### Hashing with SHA-256
```javascript
async function hashData(data) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const dataBuffer = encoder.encode(data);
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', dataBuffer);
    const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
    const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    return hashHex;
}

hashData('Hello, World!').then(console.log); // Outputs the SHA-256 hash
```

### Encrypting and Decrypting Data
```javascript
async function encryptData(data, key) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const iv = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)); // Initialization vector
    const encryptedData = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
        { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: iv },
        key,
        encoder.encode(data)
    );
    return { iv, encryptedData };
}

async function decryptData(encryptedData, key, iv) {
    const decryptedData = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
        { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: iv },
        key,
        encryptedData
    );
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    return decoder.decode(decryptedData);
}
```

### Key Generation
```javascript
async function generateKey() {
    const key = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
        { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
        true,
        ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
    );
    return key;
}
```

## Explanation
While the JavaScript Crypto API is powerful, there are several common pitfalls to be aware of:

- **Asynchronous Nature**: Many of the API's functions return promises, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. Always use `async/await` or `.then()` to ensure proper execution order.
- **Browser Compatibility**: While most modern browsers support the Crypto API, it's essential to check compatibility for older browsers.
- **Key Management**: Properly manage cryptographic keys and never expose them in client-side code. Utilize server-side solutions to handle sensitive data securely.

## One Line Summary
The JavaScript Crypto API enables secure cryptographic operations in web applications, including hashing, encryption, and key generation, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
