# XRRay: Enhancing 3D Interaction in JavaScript

## Synopsis
XRRay is a JavaScript feature in the WebXR API that allows developers to create raycasting functionalities, enabling interactions with 3D objects in virtual and augmented reality environments. It provides a way to detect intersections between a ray and objects in a 3D space, facilitating intuitive user interactions.

## Documentation

### Purpose
XRRay is designed to support raycasting in immersive environments, making it easier for developers to implement features like selection, pointing, and object manipulation. It serves as a crucial tool for enhancing user experiences in applications that utilize augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).

### Usage
To use XRRay, you must first ensure that your project is utilizing the WebXR API. Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how to create and use an XRRay:

1. **Initialization**: Create an XRRay instance, typically derived from a source such as a controller or a gaze direction.
2. **Raycasting**: Use the ray to check for intersections with 3D objects in your scene.
3. **Event Handling**: Implement event listeners to respond to user interactions based on raycasting results.

#### Example Code Snippet
```javascript
// Assuming you have a WebXR session running
const controller = xrSession.inputSources[0].gamepad; // Get the first controller
const ray = new XRRay(controller);

function checkIntersections() {
    const intersections = ray.intersect(sceneObjects);
    if (intersections.length > 0) {
        console.log('Intersection detected with:', intersections[0].object);
    }
}

// Call this function every frame to check for intersections
function render() {
    checkIntersections();
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
render();
```

### Details
- **Properties**: XRRay typically includes properties such as origin (the starting point of the ray) and direction (the vector indicating the ray's path).
- **Methods**: Methods associated with XRRay may include intersection tests and collision detection with various geometries.
- **Integration**: XRRay integrates seamlessly with other WebXR features, such as XRSession and XRInputSource, allowing for cohesive development of XR applications.

## Examples

### Basic Raycasting Example
```javascript
// Create an XRRay from a controller
const ray = new XRRay(controller);

// Function to detect intersections
function detectIntersections() {
    const hitTestResults = ray.intersect(sceneObjects);
    hitTestResults.forEach(result => {
        console.log('Hit:', result.object.name);
    });
}

// Invoke the detection function during the XR session
xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(detectIntersections);
```

### Gaze-Based Interaction
```javascript
// Create an XRRay for gaze-based interaction
const gazeRay = new XRRay(gazeOrigin);

function checkGazeIntersection() {
    const gazeHit = gazeRay.intersect(sceneObjects);
    if (gazeHit.length > 0) {
        // Highlight the object being gazed at
        gazeHit[0].object.setHighlight(true);
    }
}

// Call this function to check gaze interaction continuously
setInterval(checkGazeIntersection, 100);
```

## Explanation
When using XRRay, developers should be aware of several common pitfalls:

- **Coordinate System**: Make sure to understand the coordinate system of your 3D scene. Misalignment can lead to unexpected behaviors.
- **Performance**: Frequent raycasting in complex scenes can impact performance. Optimize the number of objects checked for intersections.
- **Event Handling**: Ensure that event listeners are properly managed to avoid memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.

## One Line Summary
XRRay is a JavaScript feature that enables raycasting for intuitive interactions with 3D objects in WebXR applications.
