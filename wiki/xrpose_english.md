# XRPose: A Comprehensive Guide to JavaScript Integration

## Synopsis
XRPose is a powerful JavaScript library designed for seamless integration with the XRP Ledger, enabling developers to build efficient applications that interact with blockchain technology.

## Documentation

### Purpose
XRPose serves as a bridge between JavaScript applications and the XRP Ledger, allowing developers to execute transactions, retrieve account information, and interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. It abstracts the complexities of direct ledger interactions, providing a straightforward API for developers.

### Usage
To get started with XRPose, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: You can install XRPose via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install xrpose
   ```

2. **Importing the Library**: Import XRPose into your JavaScript application:
   ```javascript
   const XRPose = require('xrpose');
   ```

3. **Initializing the Client**: Create an instance of the XRPose client:
   ```javascript
   const client = new XRPose.Client({
       server: 'wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233'
   });
   ```

4. **Connecting to the XRP Ledger**:
   ```javascript
   client.connect().then(() => {
       console.log('Connected to XRP Ledger');
   }).catch(err => {
       console.error('Connection error:', err);
   });
   ```

### Features
- **Transaction Handling**: Send and receive XRP with ease.
- **Account Information**: Retrieve account balances and transaction history.
- **Event Listeners**: Subscribe to ledger updates and account changes.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle common errors and exceptions.

## Examples

### Sending XRP Example
```javascript
async function sendXRP(sender, receiver, amount, secret) {
    try {
        const tx = await client.submitTransaction({
            TransactionType: 'Payment',
            Account: sender,
            Destination: receiver,
            Amount: XRPose.xrpToDrops(amount),
            Secret: secret,
        });
        console.log('Transaction submitted:', tx);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
    }
}

// Usage
sendXRP('sender_account_address', 'receiver_account_address', 10, 'your_secret_key');
```

### Retrieving Account Balance Example
```javascript
async function getAccountBalance(account) {
    try {
        const accountInfo = await client.getAccountInfo(account);
        console.log('Account balance:', XRPose.dropsToXrp(accountInfo.balance));
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching account balance:', error);
    }
}

// Usage
getAccountBalance('your_account_address');
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
- **Network Connection**: Ensure that your application can connect to the XRP Ledger server. Connection issues may arise from incorrect server URLs or network restrictions.
- **Transaction Fees**: Always account for transaction fees which are deducted from the sender's balance. Failing to include sufficient fees can result in failed transactions.
- **Secret Key Security**: Never expose your secret keys in public repositories or client-side code. Always keep them secure.

### Additional Notes
- XRPose is designed to work with both mainnet and testnet environments. Make sure to switch the server URL based on your development needs.
- The library is actively maintained, so keep an eye on the official GitHub repository for updates and new features.

## One Line Summary
XRPose is a JavaScript library for easy interaction with the XRP Ledger, simplifying blockchain application development.
