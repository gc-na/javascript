# Understanding SyntaxError in JavaScript: Causes, Examples, and Solutions

## Synopsis
In JavaScript, a `SyntaxError` occurs when the JavaScript engine encounters code that does not conform to the language's syntax rules. This error is critical for developers to understand, as it prevents the execution of scripts and can halt web applications.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`SyntaxError` is a built-in error object in JavaScript that signifies that the code you've written contains syntax mistakes. These errors typically arise during the parsing phase and indicate that the JavaScript interpreter cannot understand the code due to incorrect formatting or structure.

### Usage
The `SyntaxError` is thrown automatically by the JavaScript engine when it detects invalid syntax. Developers can also create a `SyntaxError` by using the `throw` statement, although this is less common.

### Details
- **Error Message**: The `SyntaxError` provides a message that describes what went wrong, which can aid in debugging.
- **Location**: The error message usually includes the line number and character position where the error occurred, making it easier to locate the issue in your code.

## Examples
### Example 1: Missing Parenthesis
```javascript
function greet(name {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```
*Output*: `SyntaxError: Expected ')'`

### Example 2: Unexpected Token
```javascript
let x = 5;
if (x > 2) {
    console.log("x is greater than 2"
}
```
*Output*: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token`

### Example 3: Incorrect Variable Declaration
```javascript
var 1stName = "John";
```
*Output*: `SyntaxError: Unexpected number`

## Explanation
Common pitfalls that lead to `SyntaxError` include:

1. **Typos**: Simple typographical errors, such as missing commas, parentheses, or brackets, often lead to syntax errors.
2. **Incorrect Structure**: Using incorrect structures, such as trying to declare a variable with a number at the beginning (e.g., `1stName`), will trigger a `SyntaxError`.
3. **Mismatched Quotes**: Forgetting to close string literals or mismatching single and double quotes can also result in syntax errors.

### Additional Notes
- `SyntaxError` is a subclass of the built-in `Error` object.
- While debugging, itâ€™s important to read the error message carefully, as it often points directly to the problem.
- Syntax errors are typically caught during the development phase, as they prevent the code from running.

## One Line Summary
A `SyntaxError` in JavaScript indicates that the code has incorrect syntax, preventing it from being parsed and executed.
