# CaptureController in JavaScript: Managing Media Capture Streams

## Synopsis
The `CaptureController` API in JavaScript provides a mechanism to manage and control media capture streams, allowing developers to start, stop, and manipulate media sources such as video and audio.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `CaptureController` is designed to provide a unified interface for managing media capture sessions in web applications. It enables developers to easily control the flow of media, ensuring that resources are efficiently managed and that applications can respond to user interactions effectively.

### Usage
To use the `CaptureController`, you need to create an instance of it and then invoke its methods to control media capture. The API allows you to start capturing media from devices like cameras and microphones, and to stop the capture when no longer needed.

### Methods and Properties
- **Constructor: `new CaptureController()`**
  - Creates a new `CaptureController` instance.
  
- **Methods:**
  - **`startCapture(mediaStream)`**
    - Starts capturing media from the provided `MediaStream`.
  - **`stopCapture()`**
    - Stops the currently active media capture session.
  - **`pauseCapture()`**
    - Pauses the media capture session without stopping it.
  - **`resumeCapture()`**
    - Resumes the paused media capture session.

### Example
#### Basic Usage of CaptureController
```javascript
// Create a new CaptureController instance
const captureController = new CaptureController();

// Get access to the user's media devices
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
  .then(mediaStream => {
    // Start capturing the media stream
    captureController.startCapture(mediaStream);
    
    // Handle the media stream (e.g., display it in a video element)
    const videoElement = document.querySelector('video');
    videoElement.srcObject = mediaStream;
    
    // Pause the capture after 5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      captureController.pauseCapture();
    }, 5000);
    
    // Resume the capture after another 5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      captureController.resumeCapture();
    }, 10000);
    
    // Stop the capture after 15 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      captureController.stopCapture();
    }, 15000);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error accessing media devices.', error);
  });
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Permissions**: Make sure to handle permissions correctly. Users need to grant access to their media devices; if they deny access, the `getUserMedia` promise will reject.
  
2. **Resource Management**: Always stop or pause the capture when itâ€™s no longer needed to free up system resources and prevent memory leaks.

3. **Compatibility**: Check for browser compatibility, as not all browsers may support the `CaptureController` API. Feature detection is recommended.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues when accessing media devices or during capture operations.

### Additional Notes
- The `CaptureController` is particularly useful in applications involving video conferencing, streaming, and recording.
- Always test your implementation across different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent user experience.

## One Line Summary
The `CaptureController` in JavaScript allows for efficient management and control of media capture streams, enabling developers to create interactive multimedia applications.
