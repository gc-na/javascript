# LaunchQueue: Efficiently Managing Asynchronous Tasks in JavaScript

## Synopsis
**LaunchQueue** is a JavaScript utility designed to manage and optimize the execution of asynchronous tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed in a controlled sequence and efficiently utilizing system resources.

## Documentation

### Purpose
LaunchQueue provides a structured way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, especially when tasks depend on the completion of other tasks. It helps developers manage complex workflows by queueing tasks and executing them in a specified order.

### Usage
To use LaunchQueue, you typically need to create an instance of the queue and then add tasks to it. Each task can be a function returning a promise, allowing for seamless integration with asynchronous operations.

### Method Overview
1. **Constructor**: `new LaunchQueue()`
   - Initializes a new queue instance.

2. **add(task)**: 
   - Adds a task to the queue.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `task`: A function that returns a promise.

3. **run()**:
   - Starts processing the tasks in the queue.
   - Returns a promise that resolves when all tasks have been executed.

4. **clear()**: 
   - Clears the queue of all pending tasks.

### Detailed Implementation
Here's how you might implement a simple LaunchQueue:

```javascript
class LaunchQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.queue = [];
        this.isRunning = false;
    }

    add(task) {
        this.queue.push(task);
    }

    async run() {
        this.isRunning = true;
        for (const task of this.queue) {
            await task();
        }
        this.isRunning = false;
    }

    clear() {
        this.queue = [];
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage Example
```javascript
const myQueue = new LaunchQueue();

// Adding asynchronous tasks
myQueue.add(() => new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Task 1 completed');
        resolve();
    }, 1000);
}));

myQueue.add(() => new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Task 2 completed');
        resolve();
    }, 500);
}));

// Running the tasks in the queue
myQueue.run().then(() => {
    console.log('All tasks completed');
});
```

### Chaining Tasks
```javascript
myQueue.add(async () => {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 700));
    console.log('Task 3 completed');
});

myQueue.run();
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
- **Not Returning Promises**: Ensure that the tasks added to the queue return promises; otherwise, the queue will not wait for their completion.
- **Clearing the Queue**: If you clear the queue while tasks are still executing, those tasks will be lost. Use this method judiciously.

### Gotchas
- **Concurrency Control**: LaunchQueue processes tasks sequentially. If you need concurrent execution, consider modifying the implementation to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Error Handling**: If a task fails (i.e., the promise is rejected), it can halt the execution of subsequent tasks. Implement appropriate error handling within each task to prevent this.

## One Line Summary
LaunchQueue is a JavaScript utility that helps manage and execute asynchronous tasks in a controlled, sequential manner.
