# WebSocketStream in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
WebSocketStream is a modern web API providing a way to create a stream-based communication channel over WebSockets in JavaScript, allowing for real-time, bidirectional data transfer between clients and servers.

## Documentation

### Purpose
WebSocketStream enables developers to handle streaming data more efficiently compared to traditional WebSocket APIs. It allows for the management of multiple data streams over a single WebSocket connection, enhancing performance and scalability for real-time applications.

### Usage
To utilize WebSocketStream in JavaScript, you first need to establish a WebSocket connection. Here’s how to initialize it:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");
```

Once the connection is open, you can create a WebSocketStream from this WebSocket instance:

```javascript
const stream = new WebSocketStream(ws);
```

### Details
- **Constructor**: `WebSocketStream` accepts a `WebSocket` object as a parameter.
- **Methods**: 
  - `read()`: Reads data from the stream.
  - `write(data)`: Writes data to the stream.
  - `close()`: Closes the stream and the underlying WebSocket connection.
  
- **Streams API**: It integrates with the Streams API, allowing for easy manipulation of data through readable and writable streams.

## Examples

### Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use WebSocketStream:

```javascript
// Establish a WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");

ws.onopen = () => {
    const stream = new WebSocketStream(ws);
    
    // Writing data to the stream
    stream.write("Hello, Server!");

    // Reading data from the stream
    stream.read().then(data => {
        console.log("Received:", data);
    });
};

// Closing the stream and WebSocket connection
ws.onclose = () => {
    stream.close();
    console.log("Connection closed");
};
```

### Advanced Example with Streaming Data

In this example, we’ll continuously read data from the server:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");
ws.onopen = () => {
    const stream = new WebSocketStream(ws);

    // Continuously read data
    const readStream = async () => {
        while (true) {
            const data = await stream.read();
            console.log("New message from server:", data);
        }
    };
    
    readStream();
};

// Closing the connection when done
ws.onclose = () => {
    stream.close();
    console.log("Connection closed");
};
```

## Explanation
While using WebSocketStream, developers should be aware of potential pitfalls:

- **Connection State**: Ensure the WebSocket connection is open before attempting to create a WebSocketStream or read/write data.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for both the WebSocket and the stream to gracefully manage connection issues or data transfer problems.
- **Stream Lifecycle**: Manage the lifecycle of streams carefully; always close streams when finished to free up resources.

## One Line Summary
WebSocketStream in JavaScript simplifies real-time communication by providing a stream-based interface over WebSocket connections.
