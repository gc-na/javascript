# CompressionStream in JavaScript: Efficient Data Compression for Web Applications

## Synopsis
`CompressionStream` is a built-in JavaScript API that enables developers to compress data streams using the Gzip algorithm, improving performance and reducing bandwidth consumption in web applications.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`CompressionStream` is part of the Streams API, allowing developers to efficiently compress data as it is being streamed, making it ideal for scenarios where data is sent over the network or needs to be stored in a compressed format. This feature enhances the performance of web applications by reducing the size of data transferred, leading to faster load times and lower data usage.

### Usage
To use `CompressionStream`, you need to create an instance of the `CompressionStream` class and pipe your data into it. The compressed output can then be read from the stream. The `CompressionStream` can be utilized in both readable and writable streams.

### Syntax
```javascript
const compressionStream = new CompressionStream(options);
```

**Parameters:**
- `options` (optional): An object that can include the compression algorithm (default is `"gzip"`).

### Example
Hereâ€™s a basic example illustrating how to use `CompressionStream` to compress a simple string:

```javascript
async function compressData(data) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const compressedStream = new CompressionStream();
    const readableStream = new ReadableStream({
        start(controller) {
            controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(data));
            controller.close();
        }
    });

    const compressedReadableStream = readableStream.pipeThrough(compressedStream);
    const reader = compressedReadableStream.getReader();
    let result = [];
    
    while (true) {
        const { done, value } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        result.push(value);
    }

    return new Blob(result);
}

compressData('Hello, World!')
    .then(blob => {
        console.log('Compressed Blob:', blob);
    });
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Browser Compatibility**: `CompressionStream` is relatively new and may not be supported in all browsers. Ensure to check compatibility before using it in production.
   
2. **Stream Handling**: Properly managing streams is crucial. If you forget to close the readable stream or handle errors, it may lead to memory leaks or unhandled exceptions.

3. **Data Size**: Compressing very small data may not yield significant reductions in size and could potentially increase the size due to overhead. It's best suited for larger datasets.

4. **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling when working with streams to manage potential issues gracefully.

## One Line Summary
`CompressionStream` provides an efficient way to compress data streams in JavaScript, enhancing web application performance by reducing data size during transmission.
