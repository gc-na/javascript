# TrustedTypePolicy in JavaScript: Enhancing Web Security

## Synopsis
TrustedTypePolicy is a JavaScript feature designed to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by enforcing safe handling of potentially dangerous strings in web applications. It provides a framework for creating trusted types, which can only be constructed via specific policies, ensuring that only safe values are used in sensitive contexts like HTML or JavaScript.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The primary purpose of TrustedTypePolicy is to enhance the security of web applications by preventing the injection of malicious scripts through user-generated content. By defining a set of trusted types, developers can impose strict rules on how strings are constructed and used, particularly in dynamic DOM manipulations.

### Usage
To utilize TrustedTypePolicy, developers must first create a TrustedTypePolicy instance. This instance allows you to define specific methods for creating trusted types. Here’s how to implement it:

1. **Create a TrustedTypePolicy**: You can create a policy using the `trustedTypes.createPolicy()` method.
2. **Define Trusted Types**: Within the policy, define methods that create trusted types, ensuring that only safe strings are returned.
3. **Enforce Policy**: Use the defined trusted types in your application to safely manipulate the DOM or execute JavaScript.

### API Reference

- **`trustedTypes.createPolicy(name, policy)`**: Creates a new TrustedTypePolicy with the given name and policy object.
- **`trustedTypes.getPolicy(name)`**: Retrieves the TrustedTypePolicy by its name.
- **`trustedTypes.policyNames`**: Returns an array of the names of all created policies.

### Example
Here’s a simple example demonstrating the creation of a TrustedTypePolicy and its usage:

```javascript
// Create a TrustedTypePolicy
const policy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
    createHTML: (input) => {
        // Here, you'd validate the input to ensure it's safe
        return input;  // For demonstration, return input directly
    },
    createScript: (input) => {
        // Similar validation for scripts
        return input;
    }
});

// Using the TrustedTypePolicy
const safeHTML = policy.createHTML('<div>Hello, World!</div>');
document.body.innerHTML = safeHTML; // Safe to use
```

### Explanation
While TrustedTypePolicy significantly improves security, developers should be aware of the following common pitfalls:

- **Validation**: Failure to properly validate input can lead to vulnerabilities. Always sanitize input when creating trusted types.
- **Browser Support**: Ensure that your target browsers support Trusted Types, as it may not be available in older versions.
- **Fallbacks**: Consider implementing fallbacks for browsers that do not support Trusted Types, as it could lead to broken functionalities.
- **Performance**: Overuse of Trusted Types may introduce performance overhead. Use them judiciously for sensitive operations.

## One Line Summary
TrustedTypePolicy is a JavaScript feature that enhances web security by enforcing safe handling of potentially dangerous strings to prevent XSS attacks.
