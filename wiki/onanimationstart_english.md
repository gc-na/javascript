# Understanding the JavaScript onanimationstart Event: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `onanimationstart` event in JavaScript is triggered when a CSS animation begins. It provides developers with a way to execute specific JavaScript code in response to the start of an animation, enhancing interactivity and control over animated elements.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `onanimationstart` event is part of the CSS Animation API, which allows developers to listen for the start of an animation on an element. This event is useful for executing code at the moment an animation begins, enabling dynamic responses to user interactions or state changes in a web application.

### Usage
To use the `onanimationstart` event, you can attach an event listener to a DOM element that has a CSS animation applied. The event listener will execute a specified function when the animation starts.

### Syntax
```javascript
element.onanimationstart = function(event) {
    // Your code here
};
```

### Event Properties
The `onanimationstart` event provides an `AnimationEvent` object with useful properties:
- **animationName**: The name of the animation that has started.
- **elapsedTime**: The time in seconds that the animation has been running at the point the event was fired.
- **target**: The element that is the target of the event.

## Examples
### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the `onanimationstart` event:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Animation Start Example</title>
    <style>
        .animate {
            animation-name: exampleAnimation;
            animation-duration: 4s;
        }
        
        @keyframes exampleAnimation {
            from {background-color: red;}
            to {background-color: yellow;}
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="animatedBox" class="animate" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"></div>
    <script>
        const box = document.getElementById('animatedBox');
        
        box.onanimationstart = function(event) {
            console.log('Animation started:', event.animationName);
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Example with Multiple Animations
You can also handle multiple animations by checking the `animationName` property:

```javascript
box.onanimationstart = function(event) {
    if (event.animationName === 'exampleAnimation') {
        console.log('First animation started');
    } else if (event.animationName === 'secondAnimation') {
        console.log('Second animation started');
    }
};
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **CSS Support**: Ensure that the CSS animations are correctly defined and supported in the browsers you are targeting, as the event will not trigger if the animation does not start.
- **Multiple Animations**: If multiple animations are applied to an element, the `onanimationstart` event will fire for each animation. Make sure to handle each case appropriately using the `animationName` property.
- **Event Attachment**: If the `onanimationstart` event is not working as expected, double-check that the event listener is correctly attached before the animation starts. 

### Gotchas
- The event will not fire if the animation is interrupted or if it does not exist.
- If you remove the animation class before the animation starts, the event will not trigger.

## One Line Summary
The `onanimationstart` event in JavaScript enables developers to execute code at the moment a CSS animation begins, enhancing control over animated elements.
