# StorageBucketManager: Efficiently Manage Storage Buckets in JavaScript

## Synopsis
The `StorageBucketManager` is a JavaScript utility designed for managing cloud storage buckets efficiently. It provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting storage buckets, streamlining cloud data management.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `StorageBucketManager` is intended for developers working with cloud storage services, such as Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3. It abstracts the complexities involved in managing storage buckets, allowing developers to focus on building applications without getting bogged down by the underlying API intricacies.

### Usage
To utilize the `StorageBucketManager`, you will need to initialize it with the appropriate configuration settings. This typically includes credentials and the storage service endpoint. Below is a brief overview of the methods available within the `StorageBucketManager` class:

- **createBucket(name)**: Creates a new storage bucket with the specified name.
- **getBucket(name)**: Retrieves metadata and information about a specific bucket.
- **listBuckets()**: Lists all storage buckets associated with the account.
- **deleteBucket(name)**: Deletes the specified storage bucket, along with its contents.
- **updateBucket(name, options)**: Updates the settings or configurations of an existing bucket.

### Example
```javascript
// Initialize StorageBucketManager
const bucketManager = new StorageBucketManager({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
});

// Create a new bucket
bucketManager.createBucket('my-new-bucket')
    .then(response => console.log('Bucket created:', response))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error creating bucket:', error));

// List all buckets
bucketManager.listBuckets()
    .then(buckets => console.log('Available buckets:', buckets))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error listing buckets:', error));

// Get details of a specific bucket
bucketManager.getBucket('my-new-bucket')
    .then(bucket => console.log('Bucket details:', bucket))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching bucket details:', error));

// Delete a bucket
bucketManager.deleteBucket('my-old-bucket')
    .then(response => console.log('Bucket deleted:', response))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error deleting bucket:', error));
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **API Authentication**: Ensure that you have the correct API credentials and that they have the necessary permissions to create, read, or delete buckets.
- **Bucket Names**: Bucket names must be globally unique across the cloud storage provider. Attempting to create a bucket with an existing name will result in an error.
- **Region Specifications**: Some storage providers require buckets to be created in specific geographic regions. Always check the provider's documentation for regional restrictions.
- **Deleting Buckets**: Deleting a bucket will permanently remove all contained objects. Ensure you have backups if necessary.

### Gotchas
- **Rate Limits**: Cloud storage APIs often have rate limits. Be mindful of the number of requests you make in a short period to avoid throttling.
- **Asynchronous Behavior**: Operations like creating or deleting a bucket are asynchronous. Always handle promises correctly or use async/await to ensure operations complete as expected.

## One Line Summary
The `StorageBucketManager` is a JavaScript utility that simplifies the management of cloud storage buckets, providing essential methods for bucket operations.
