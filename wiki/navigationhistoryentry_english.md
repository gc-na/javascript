# NavigationHistoryEntry in JavaScript: Understanding Browser Navigation States

## Synopsis
The `NavigationHistoryEntry` interface in JavaScript provides access to the navigation history of a browsing context, allowing developers to interact with the entries in the session history.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `NavigationHistoryEntry` interface is part of the History API and is designed to facilitate the management and retrieval of browsing session history entries. This API is particularly useful for web applications that require a sophisticated handling of user navigation, enabling developers to enhance user experience and maintain state across page reloads or navigation.

### Usage
In order to interact with `NavigationHistoryEntry`, you typically access it through the `history` object. The properties and methods of this interface enable you to read details about previous navigation entries, including URLs, titles, and the time at which the entry was created.

### Properties
- **id**: A unique identifier for the history entry.
- **url**: The URL of the history entry.
- **title**: The title of the document associated with the history entry.
- **timestamp**: The time at which the history entry was created.

### Methods
- **go(delta)**: Navigates to a specific entry in the history stack based on the provided delta (positive or negative integer).
- **pushState(state, title, url)**: Adds a new entry to the session history stack.
- **replaceState(state, title, url)**: Modifies the current entry in the session history stack.

## Examples

### Example 1: Accessing Navigation History Entry
```javascript
// Accessing the current history entry
let currentEntry = history.state; // Retrieves the state of the current history entry
console.log(currentEntry);
```

### Example 2: Pushing a New State
```javascript
// Pushing a new state into the history
history.pushState({ key: 'value' }, 'New Title', '/new-url');
```

### Example 3: Navigating Back in History
```javascript
// Navigating back one entry in the history
history.go(-1); // Equivalent to going back to the previous page
```

## Explanation
When working with `NavigationHistoryEntry`, it is important to note that not all browsers may support every method or property of the History API consistently. Additionally, entries in the history stack can be affected by actions like form submissions or page reloads. 

Common pitfalls include:
- Attempting to access `history.state` when there are no states set, which will return `null`.
- Using incorrect URLs or states that may cause unexpected behavior in navigation.
- Overusing the `pushState` method can lead to cluttered history if not managed properly, potentially confusing users.

Ensure that any state you push with `pushState` can be accurately represented and restored, as this will enhance the user experience and maintain application integrity.

## One Line Summary
The `NavigationHistoryEntry` interface in JavaScript allows developers to manage and retrieve entries in the browser's navigation history, enhancing user navigation and session management.
