# Understanding TypeError in JavaScript: Causes, Examples, and Solutions

## Synopsis
In JavaScript, a `TypeError` is an exception that occurs when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type. This article delves into the nature of `TypeError`, its common causes, and practical examples to help developers diagnose and resolve such errors.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`TypeError` is one of the built-in error types in JavaScript, specifically designed to signal that a variable is not of the expected type. This can occur in various scenarios, such as when trying to access properties of `undefined`, invoking non-functions, or using incompatible types in operations.

### Usage
A `TypeError` can be thrown in several contexts:
- **Accessing properties of `undefined` or `null`**: When you attempt to read a property or call a method on an `undefined` or `null` value.
- **Calling a non-function**: If you try to invoke a variable that is not a function, a `TypeError` is thrown.
- **Invalid arguments**: When passing arguments of the wrong type to built-in functions or methods.

### Details
- `TypeError` is a subclass of the `Error` object, and it can be used to create custom error messages.
- You can catch a `TypeError` using a `try...catch` block to handle errors gracefully in your JavaScript code.

## Examples
### Example 1: Accessing Properties of `undefined`
```javascript
let obj;
console.log(obj.property); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

### Example 2: Calling a Non-Function
```javascript
let notAFunction = "Hello World";
notAFunction(); // TypeError: notAFunction is not a function
```

### Example 3: Incorrect Argument Type
```javascript
let num = 5;
console.log(num.toUpperCase()); // TypeError: num.toUpperCase is not a function
```

## Explanation
Common pitfalls that lead to `TypeError` include:
- **Undefined Variables**: Always ensure that variables are defined before accessing their properties or methods.
- **Type Mismatches**: Be cautious when passing values to functions. Ensure that the expected type matches the provided type.
- **Function References**: Verify that the variable you are calling as a function is indeed a function. Use `typeof` to check before invoking.

When debugging `TypeError`, using `console.log()` can help identify the state of variables leading up to the error. Additionally, leveraging modern development tools can aid in tracing back the source of the error.

## One Line Summary
A `TypeError` in JavaScript signals that an operation has been performed on a value of an unexpected type, often resulting from undefined variables, non-functions, or incorrect argument types.
