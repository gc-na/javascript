# Understanding URIError in JavaScript: Causes, Usage, and Examples

## Synopsis
URIError is a built-in error object in JavaScript that is thrown when there is an issue with URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) handling, often due to malformed URI sequences.

## Documentation
### Purpose
URIError is part of JavaScript's native error handling mechanism. It arises primarily from functions that encode or decode URIs, specifically when the input string contains malformed escape sequences. This error helps developers identify issues related to URI manipulation.

### Usage
In JavaScript, URIError is typically generated by the following functions:
- `decodeURI()`: This function decodes a complete URI. It throws a URIError if the URI contains characters that are not properly encoded.
- `decodeURIComponent()`: This function decodes a URI component. It will raise a URIError for malformed URI sequences.
- `encodeURI()`: This function encodes a URI by replacing each instance of certain characters with one or more escape sequences, but does not throw a URIError itself.
- `encodeURIComponent()`: Similar to `encodeURI`, but it encodes every character that is not a valid URI character.

### Details
When a URIError is thrown, it can be caught using a try-catch block, allowing developers to handle the error gracefully. The error message typically provides insight into the nature of the URI issue.

Example of handling a URIError:

```javascript
try {
    decodeURIComponent('%E0%A4%A');
} catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof URIError) {
        console.error('Caught a URIError: ', e.message);
    }
}
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Triggering a URIError
```javascript
try {
    console.log(decodeURIComponent('%E0%A4%A')); // This will throw a URIError
} catch (e) {
    console.error('Error:', e); // Output: Error: URI malformed
}
```

### Example 2: Proper URI Decoding
```javascript
const uri = 'https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F';
const decodedUri = decodeURIComponent(uri);
console.log(decodedUri); // Output: https://example.com/
```

### Example 3: Using encodeURIComponent
```javascript
const component = 'Hello World!';
const encodedComponent = encodeURIComponent(component);
console.log(encodedComponent); // Output: Hello%20World%21
```

## Explanation
Common pitfalls when dealing with URIError include:
- **Malformed Input**: The most frequent cause of a URIError is providing improperly encoded strings to `decodeURIComponent` or `decodeURI`. Always ensure that the string is correctly formatted before decoding.
- **Uncaught Errors**: If not handled properly, a URIError can interrupt the execution of your script. Use try-catch blocks to manage this error effectively.
- **Confusion with Other Errors**: URIError can be confused with other error types, such as ReferenceError or TypeError. Ensure you are checking for the correct error type when handling exceptions.

## One Line Summary
URIError in JavaScript indicates issues with URI encoding or decoding, typically arising from malformed input.
