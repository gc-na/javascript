# NotRestoredReasons in JavaScript: Understanding the Restoration Process

## Synopsis
The `NotRestoredReasons` is a critical concept in JavaScript that pertains to the restoration of a given object or state within the runtime environment. Understanding this feature can help developers troubleshoot issues related to object restoration and state management.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`NotRestoredReasons` is a property used in JavaScript frameworks and environments that deal with state management, particularly in applications utilizing features such as Undo/Redo functionality. This property provides insights into why certain objects or states could not be restored to a previous condition.

### Usage
Typically, `NotRestoredReasons` can be accessed through a state management library or a framework that implements a state restoration mechanism. Developers can utilize this property to gain information about the restoration process and handle errors effectively.

### Details
- **Type**: Array of strings
- **Context**: It is often found in libraries that manage state, like Redux or MobX, where state restoration is a common requirement.
- **Common Reasons**: The reasons for a state not being restored can include:
  - The state object has been mutated.
  - Dependencies required for restoration are missing.
  - The state is out of bounds or invalid.

## Examples
### Basic Usage Example
```javascript
const stateManager = new StateManager();

// Attempt to restore state
const restorationResult = stateManager.restoreState(previousState);

if (restorationResult.NotRestoredReasons.length > 0) {
    console.log("State restoration failed due to:", restorationResult.NotRestoredReasons);
}
```

### Handling NotRestoredReasons
```javascript
function handleStateRestoration(state) {
    const result = stateManager.restoreState(state);
    
    if (result.NotRestoredReasons.length > 0) {
        result.NotRestoredReasons.forEach(reason => {
            console.warn("Restoration Issue:", reason);
        });
        // Implement additional error handling here
    } else {
        console.log("State restored successfully!");
    }
}
```

## Explanation
When working with state restoration in JavaScript, developers should be aware of the potential pitfalls that can lead to the `NotRestoredReasons` being populated. Common issues include:

- **State Mutation**: If the state has been altered after it was saved, the restoration process may fail.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Certain properties or references required for restoration may not exist in the current context.
- **Invalid State**: The state being restored must conform to the expected shape and constraints of the application.

Understanding these factors is crucial for effective debugging and ensuring a smooth user experience in applications that rely heavily on state management.

## One Line Summary
`NotRestoredReasons` is an essential property in JavaScript state management that identifies why a state could not be restored, aiding developers in troubleshooting restoration issues.
